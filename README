py-ApeTag (formally pylibape/py-apev2tag) is a pure Python library for
manipulating both APE and ID3v1 tags.  It aims for standards compliance with
the APE spec (http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~pfk/mpp/sv8/apetag.html). APE is
the standard tagging format for Musepack (.mpc) and Monkey's Audio files
(.ape), and it can also be used with mp3s as an alternative to the mess that is
ID3v2.x (technically, it can be used on any file type and is not limited to
storing just audio file metadata).

The module is in written in pure Python, so it should be useable on all 
platforms that Python supports.  The primary testing platform is currently 
Windows.

The library is complete, but it hasn't been widely used, so there may still be
some bugs in it.  I haven't found any bugs in my normal use of it that I
haven't already fixed, though.

The public functions should be named obviously.  There are functions for
creating, replacing, updating, and deleting APE and ID3 tags both separately
and together.  There are also functions for getting the fields and the raw
string for the APE and ID3 tags separately.  Public function arguments, return
values, and various notes are stored in the module docstring.

To run the tests for the library, see the README.tests file.

If you find any bugs, would like additional documentation, or want to submit a
patch, please use Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylibape/).

The most current source code can be accessed via anonymous SVN at 
svn://209.220.159.58/py-ApeTag/.  Note that the library isn't modified on a
regular basis, so it is unlikely to be different from the latest release.

Thank you for downloading this library. I hope you find it useful. 

Changelog:
0.9 - 2005-03-20
- Rename module from apev2tag to ApeTag
- Remove apev2tag and id3tag functions, the helper functions that debuted in
  0.8 are now the public interface to the library
- Significant internal changes, most notably error handling during APE tag
  parsing (fixing a possible denial of service caused by a malicious tag) and
  automated closing of files opened by the library
- Return values for the APE create, update, replace, and getfields functions
  have changed, they now returns of dict with ApeItem (a list subclass with
  unicode strings) values, instead of the previous dict with values that could
  be strings, unicode strings, could be lists, or dicts.
- Easier benchmarking in speedtest, defaults to test all functions
- Added ability to read, create, and modify the read only tag flag.
- Added ability to modify the maximum size of APE tags (default still 8K)

0.8 - 2005-03-13
- Helper functions such as createtags, deletetags, getrawapev2, getid3fields,
  etc. added so you don't have to call id3tag and apev2tag directly with the
  appropriate action.
- You can now pass a filename instead of a file-like object to any of the
  public functions.
- Revised tests removing much of the duplicative code
- Line endings for all files converted to LF (was a mix of LF and CRLF before)
  
0.7 - 2005-02-05
- Entire code base refactored, resulting in major performance enhancements in
  parsing and writing APEv2 tags (over twice as fast as 0.6)
- Code made simpler, more modular, and less duplicative
- Internal functions changed to private functions
- TagError class simplified, now raised similar to other exceptions
- Private module variables added (acting as constants)
- Import of string removed (hasn't been necessary since 0.5)

0.6 - 2004-07-17
- Rename module from pylibape to apev2tag
- Rename functions from ape and id3 to apev2tag and id3tag
- Instead of searching through the last 8K of the file, use the information in
  the APEv2 tag footer to locate the rest of the tag
- Minor fixes elsewhere

0.5 - 2004-02-14
- Initial public release
