pylibape is a pure python library for manipulating both APEv2 and ID3v1.1 tags.
It aims for standards compliance with the APEv2 spec 
(http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~pfk/mpp/sv8/apetag.html).  APEv2 is the 
standard tagging format for Musepack (.mpc) files, though it can also be used 
with mp3s as an alternative to the mess than is ID3v2.

It should be useable on all platforms that Python supports, though the primary 
testing platform is currently Windows.

The library is mostly complete, but hasn't undergone thorough bugtesting.

The library has two functions (ape and id3) and one class (TagError).  At the
risk of being obvious, ape manipulates APEv2 tags, and id3 manipulates ID3v1.1
tags.  TagError is raised if there is a problem with the tag itself, or with
the calling arguments.  For a complete description about how to use the 
library, install it and then run the following commands from inside the python 
interpreter:

import pylibape
help(pylibape)

If you find any bugs, would like additional documentation, or want to submit a
patch, please use Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pylibape/).

Thank you for downloading this library. I hope you find it useful. 

Sincerely,
