py-apev2tag (formally pylibape) is a pure python library for manipulating both 
APEv2 and ID3v1.1 tags.  It aims for standards compliance with the APEv2 spec 
(http://www.personal.uni-jena.de/~pfk/mpp/sv8/apetag.html).  APEv2 is the 
standard tagging format for Musepack (.mpc) files, and it can also be used 
with mp3s as an alternative to the mess than is ID3v2.

The module is in written in pure python, so it should be useable on all 
platforms that Python supports.  The primary testing platform is currently 
Windows.

The library is mostly complete, but hasn't undergone thorough bugtesting.  I 
haven't found any bugs in my normal use of it that I haven't already fixed

The library has two functions (apev2tag and id3tag) and one class (TagError).  
At the risk of being obvious, ape manipulates APEv2 tags, and id3 manipulates 
ID3v1.1 tags.  TagError is raised if there is a problem with the tag itself, or
with the calling arguments.  For a complete description about how to use the 
library, install it and then run the following commands from inside the python 
interpreter:

import apev2tag
help(apev2tag)

To run the tests for the library, see the README.tests file.

If you find any bugs, would like additional documentation, or want to submit a
patch, please use Sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/py-apev2tag/).

Thank you for downloading this library. I hope you find it useful. 

Sincerely,
