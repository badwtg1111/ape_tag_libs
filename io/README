io-apetag
----------

io-apetag is an io library for reading and writing APEv2 tags.  

It aims for standards compliance with the APE spec (1). APEv2 is the standard
tagging format for Musepack (.mpc) and Monkey's Audio files (.ape), and it can
also be used with mp3s as an alternative to ID3v2.x (technically, it can be
used on any file type and is not limited to storing just audio file metadata).

Example Usage
-------------

tag = ApeTag withFile("file.mp3")

tag hasApe
  # whether file already has an APEv2 tag

tag hasId3
  # whether file already has an ID3v1 tag

tag removeTag
  # remove the APEv2 and ID3v1 tags from the file

tag fields
  # An object used as a hash table for the fields in the tag.
  # slotNames gives the keys, and getSlot(key) gives the array
  # of values for the keys.

tag fields title at(0)
  # First value for the title field

tag items
  # A list of ApeItems representing the items in the tag.
  # This is an alternate representation of the fields that gives
  # more information about the fields, such as the flags and the
  # read only field. Each ApeItem has key, values, flags, and
  # readOnly slots.

tag items map(key)
  # List of item keys for all items in the tag

tag addItem(key, values, flags, readOnly)
  # Add an item to the tag with the given key and values, and
  # option type flag and readOnly flag.  Returns self for
  # easy method chaining.

tag removeItem(key)
  # Removes the item with the given key from the tag.  Returns
  # self for easy method chaining.

tag update
  # Writes the updated tag back to the file.
