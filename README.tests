The tests for py-apev2tag are located in the tests directory.  After you have
installed py-apev2tag, create a subdirectory named tagtest under tests and 
copy the files that you would like to test into the tests/tagtest directory. 
Then run one of the scripts in the tests directory.

WARNING: Other than getfields and getrawtag, the other tests modify the files
    you place in the tests/tagtest directory, so you should copy the files you
    want to test, and not just move them into the directory.

The tests are appropriately named, but here's a more thorough description of 
each:

create.py: Creates both tags on the files, or updates the tags already
    there.  It adds the apev2 fields 'TestTitle' and 'TestArtist', and sets the
    id3 'track' field to 0.
    
delete.py: Deletes both or either tags on the files, if present.

getfields.py: Prints out the string representation of the python dictionary
    of the fields in both tags.
    
getrawtag.py: Prints out the raw tag string for both tags.

replace.py: Deletes both tags from the files, if they exist, and
    creates new tags using the same info as create.py.

update.py: Updates both tags, if they exist, by swapping the artist and title 
    fields.

After you have run create, delete, replace, or update, you should run getfields
    or getrawtag to see if the tests were successful.
	
Additionally, there is a module named speedtest that can be used to test speeds
for various tagging operations (used to test the performance increase
between 0.6 and 0.7, which turned about to be over 100%).  Using this module,
you can test relative speeds of the different tag actions (and different
versions of py-apev2tag). On my machine, the following is true for a sample
album (10 tracks, 45 minutes):

getrawtag is the fastest operation
getfields takes about 52% longer than getrawtag
delete takes about 61% longer than getrawtag
create takes about 87% longer than getrawtag
replace takes about 128% longer than getrawtag
update takes about 272% longer than getrawtag

In terms of total time for the entire album (yes, those are in milliseconds):
getrawtag = 6.9ms
getfields = 10.5ms
delete = 11.1ms
create = 12.9ms
replace = 15.7ms
update = 25.7ms
