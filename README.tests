The tests for py-ApeTag are located in the tests directory.  After you have
installed py-ApeTag, create a subdirectory named tagtest under tests and 
copy the files that you would like to test into the tests/tagtest directory. 
Then run one of the scripts in the tests directory.

WARNING: Other than getfields and getrawtag, the other tests modify the files
    you place in the tests/tagtest directory, so you should copy the files you
    want to test, and not just move them into the directory.

The tests should be appropriately named.  After you have run create, delete,
replace, or update, you should run getfields or getrawtag to see if the tests
were successful. To test different values for the tests, modify the fields
variable in walktree.py.
	
Additionally, there is a module named speedtest that can be used to test speeds
for various tagging operations.  Using this module, you can test relative
speeds of the different tag actions. On my machine, the following is true for a
sample album (10 tracks, 45 minutes, for both tags):

getrawtag is the fastest operation
getfields takes about 78% longer than getrawtag
replace takes about 118% longer than getrawtag
create takes about 138% longer than getrawtag
delete takes about 141% longer than getrawtag
update takes about 185% longer than getrawtag

In terms of total time for the entire album:
getrawtag = 7.4ms
getfields = 13.2ms
replace = 16.1ms
delete = 17.6ms
create = 17.8ms
update = 21.1ms

Speeds were roughly 100% faster going from version 0.6 to 0.7, about 20%
slower going from version 0.8 to 0.9, with that time more than gained back
between 0.9 and 0.10.  Version 0.11 was about 10% faster than version 0.10.
Versions 0.12 and 0.11 are about the same speed.  Note that the time 
comparisons are not perfect, since the speed tests have changed with the 
versions.
