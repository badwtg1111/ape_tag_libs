The tests for py-apev2tag are located in the tests directory.  After you have
installed py-apev2tag, create a subdirectory named tagtest under tests and 
copy the files that you would like to test into the tests/tagtest directory. 
Then run one of the scripts in the tests directory.

WARNING: Other than getfields and getrawtag, the other tests modify the files
    you place in the tests/tagtest directory, so you should copy the files you
    want to test, and not just move them into the directory.

The tests should be appropriately named.  Create, replace, and update modify 
the Title, Artist, and Track fields to 'Test Create Title', 'Test Create
Artist' and 0, respectively. After you have run create, delete, replace, or 
update, you should run getfields or getrawtag to see if the tests were
successful.
	
Additionally, there is a module named speedtest that can be used to test speeds
for various tagging operations.  Using this module, you can test relative
speeds of the different tag actions. On my machine, the following is true for a
sample album (10 tracks, 45 minutes):

getrawtag is the fastest operation
getfields takes about 13% longer than getrawtag
delete takes about 34% longer than getrawtag
replace takes about 85% longer than getrawtag
create takes about 91% longer than getrawtag
update takes about 93% longer than getrawtag

In terms of total time for the entire album (yes, those are in milliseconds):
getrawtag = 13.0ms
getfields = 14.7ms
delete = 17.4ms
replace = 24.0ms
create = 24.8ms
update = 25.1ms
