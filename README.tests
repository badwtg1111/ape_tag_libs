The tests for py-apev2tag are located in the tests directory.  After you have
installed py-apev2tag, create a subdirectory named tagtest under tests and 
copy the files that you would like to test into the tests/tagtest directory. 
Then run one of the scripts in the tests directory.

WARNING: Other than getfields and getrawtag, the other tests modify the files
    you place in the tests/tagtest directory, so you should copy the files you
    want to test, and not just move them into the directory.

The tests are appropriately named, but here's a more thorough description of 
each:

create.py: Creates both tags on the files, or updates the tags already
    there.  It adds the apev2 fields 'TestTitle' and 'TestArtist', and sets the
    id3 'track' field it sets to 0.
    
delete.py: Deletes both or either tags on the files, if present.

getfields.py: Prints out the string representation of the python dictionary
    of the fields in both tags.
    
getrawtag.py: Prints out the raw tag string for both tags.

replace.py: Deletes both tags from the files, if they exist, and
    creates new tags using the same info as create.py.

update.py: Updates both tags, if they exist, by swapping the artist and title 
    fields.

After you have run create, delete, replace, or update, you should run getfields
    or getrawtag to see if the tests were successful.
